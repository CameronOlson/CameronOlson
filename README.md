### Hi there 👋 I'm Cam

I am currently enroled in CodeWorks full-stack developer program. I have had a slew of job-titles ranging from wildland firefighter and ESL teacher to raidio host and A/V tech. Throughout all of those jobs the one thing that was always present was a desire to learn to code. 

I'm currently learning JS with a focus on MVS and async code.
